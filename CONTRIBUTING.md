## WCFC-Apps

Unfortunately, the source code to these apps cannot be made public at this time.  The code is MIT licensed and
it may be possible to open source it in future, but currently this is not possible.  Also, the apps are of limited
interest outside Wings of Carolina.

If you have a specific bugfix or improvement you'd like to contribute, if it's small enough to submit through an
issue, do that; otherwise, get in touch with us and we'll figure it out.
